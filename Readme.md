# Spotify Web 🕸️🕷️

## What is it?

Add to and traverse a web of songs created by users. Spotify Web is a project meant to find a more 
human way to find song reccomendations and to share them with friends. The project is still a work
in progress, the readme will be updated to reflect features as they are added.

## How to run locally

clone this repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poozipotti/spotify_web.git

### TODO Spotify Setup instructions
this is a todo section because I need to lookup the spotify auth instructions again and add them to the 
readme.

the server must be started and running before the client can start or it will fail.
Individual running instructions are in earch folder, `/api` & `/client`.
